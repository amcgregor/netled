.SH NAME
netled \- device monitoring utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netled
<console> <interface> [refresh] [-k]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netled 
is a device monitoring utility designed to help a system administrator monitor the transmission and recieving of data over a loopback, ppp connection, or ethernet (hell, anything that
.BR ifconfig
can tell you about. 
.BR netled 
was written in C in hopes for an increase in program speed,
efficency, and availability of more options, as opposed to other
shell/perl scripts that are around.  It was designed to ease
the pain of admins who use \'
.BR ifconfig
and
.BR pppstats
to monitor connections.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "console"
Selects the console you wish to change the LEDs for.  "ttyX" or use "console"
to change the LEDs for all of them.
.br
.I "Example: \'netled tty2 ppp0\'"
.TP
.I "interface"
Select the interface (device) you wish to monitor.  Anything that
.BR ifconfig
can display,
.BR netled
can monitor.  eth0, lo, ppp0, etc.
.br
.I "Example: \'netled console ppp0\'
.TP
.I "refresh"
Set the refresh rate.  The default is 100ms.
.TP
.I "\-k"
Kill.  In a later version, this will be implemented.  If anyone can tell me how to implement running NetLED perminantly in the background (pid file?) please e-mail me.
.br
.I "Example: \'netled console ppp0 500\'

.SH BUGS
It seems that my program will not correctly change the condition
of the keyboard LEDs under some versions/configurations of X.  Fixed in this
version is a problem with security, a problem with people typing /dev/ in
front of the device, and gave the user some options regarding to
downloading...

.SH FIX
If anyone fixes any bugs, or modifies my program in any way, can you please
e-mail me a diff file containing your changes and a description of what they
do? Thanks!

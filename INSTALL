Instalation of NetLED is easy.  Follow these easy steps:
    1) go to the directory where the sources are held
    2) type "make install"
    3) if there were no errors, and you are running
	a) as root
	b) a Red-Hat 6.1 machine
       then type "make installrc" to install the daemon startup/shutdown
       in the /etc/rc.d directory.  If you changed the location of the
       NetLED executable, you must edit the files in the rc.d directory
       (where the sources are held) by hand and change the paths.
	
See the man page for instructions on running the program.

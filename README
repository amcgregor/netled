NetLED is a program I wrote to monitor connections.  NetLED uses a
configuration file to control what LED on the keyboard represents what
command.  An example configuration file folows:
 ______________________________________________________________________________
 
  # This is the default configuration file for NetLED.  For more infrmation,
  # have a peek at the netled.conf man page.
  # ???LOCK     MC      # Whatever Lock  ->  Modem LED
    CAPLOCK     SD      # Caps Lock      -> Send Data
    SCRLOCK     RD      # Scroll Lock    -> Recieve Data
    NUMLOCK     CD      # Num Lock       -> Carrier Detect

The setupfile is not currently used.  It will be implemented in later versions.
Running "netled" by itself will spit the following at you:

NetLED Version 1.1 (see COPYING for lisence information)

  usage: netled [-k] [-w wait_time] <console> <interface> ... 
    -k             Kill the running deamon.
                     (Not yet implemented -- do not use!)
    -w wait_time   Select how long to pause between checking for activity.
                   Defaults to 100 milliseconds.
    console        Select a console to flash the leds on.
    interface      Select running interface(s) (up to 3) to monitor.

NetLED is a strange title.  In my terms, it means "Network Light Emitting
Deamon", but to most it means, "Networked Light Emitting Diode"

The NetLED executable must be SUID Root, because of problems writing to
/dev/console or whatever terminal you choose.  Only root can write to those
devices.

To find out what devices you can use, type ifconfig.  Anything listed can be
used.  There should be at least a "lo" entry.  If you have a network, eth0
should be there too.  If you are connected to the internet via a PPP
connection, ppp0 should be there.  You can choose any of these.

Note: You can use "/dev/" in the device names if you want, but you don't have
to.  For the console device (e.g. /dev/console), NetLED accepts and uses the
"/dev/" string.  For the network devices (e.g. ppp0, eth0), the "/dev/" string
is inappropriate (after all, in Linux the network devices aren't in the /dev
directory), and NetLED strips it off.

For example, this will work: 

    netled /dev/console /dev/ppp0

but NetLED just converts it to:

    netled console ppp0
